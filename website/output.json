            "selftext": "I'm having trouble comprehending how Actively Managed ETFs work, with regards to getting money to make investment decisions. Did some sleuthing on Google, but none of the resources I found adequately explain the process. Appreciate the help!\n\nPlease correct my understanding if the following is out of touch with reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a passively managed ETF, I believe the following is accurate.\n\nLet's say, for example, AWESOMEETF, a passive ETF. For simplicity, the fund currently only have 1 outstanding share, and holds the following securities:\n\n \\- AAPL $100 - 1 share - 50% weight\n\n \\- GOOG $10  - 10 shares - 50% weight\n\n Total Net Assets is $200\n\nNet Asset Value of the fund found to be $200 / share\n\nStarting Market Price of Fund is $200 / share\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree scenarios:\n\n1. If there is a buyer wanting 1 share, and the seller is willing to sell it to him, then the shares just exchanges hands. There's no change in the fund holdings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. If there is a buyer wanting 1 share, and the seller is NOT willing to sell. That means the share would trade at a premium to the NAV, let's say $210. This is when the authorized participant (AP) steps in and creates a share by assembling a basket of AAPL/GOOG shares. He would purchase 1 share of AAPL, and 10 shares of GOOG, and deliver that to AWESOMEETF. AWESOMEETF in turn will issue 1 share of the fund. The AP spent $200 and sold the share to our buyer at $210.\n\n \\- AAPL $100 - 2 share - 50% weight\n\n \\- GOOG $10  - 20 shares - 50% weight\n\nTotal Net Assets is $400\n\nNet Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. If our buyer had a change of heart and want to get rid of his 1 share, and we do not have any buyer willing to step in to take his share. That means the share would trade at a discount to the NAV, let's say $190. The AP would step in, buy the share from our paper handed person, redeem it against AWESOMEETF, and get 1 share of AAPL and 10 shares of GOOG. He can then sell at market price for $200, and make $10 from the transaction.\n\n \\- AAPL $100 - 1 share - 50% weight\n\n \\- GOOG $10  - 10 shares - 50% weight\n\nTotal Net Assets is $200\n\nNet Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I understand how fees are handled. Fees for the fund, such as management fee, trading costs, salary, and whatever, would be deducted from the Total Net Assets, and would thus reduce Market Price/share. This creates a discount of Market Price/share to NAV/share for the basket of stock. Thus, the trusty AP steps in again and redeem some fund shares for a basket of stock to bring Market the NAV / share back to Market Price/share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNow, let's say AWESOMEETF is now an Actively Managed ETF.\n\n1. What I do not grasp is how AWESOMEETF gets money to buy another stock. Since the AP only ever deliver and redeem shares, the portfolio manager never sees cash. Does that mean if the portfolio manager wants to buy some FB, then the only way to get the funds would be by selling a portion of AAPL or AME?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. If let's say that is indeed the case. If the portfolio manager sells 5 shares of GOOG to buy 1 share of FB. Our fund breakdown would be:\n\n \\- AAPL  $100 - 1 share  - 50% weight\n\n \\- GOOG  $10  - 5 shares - 25% weight\n\n \\- FB $20  - 1 share  - 10% weight\n\n \\- cash $30             - 15% weight\n\nIgnoring transaction costs, the Total Net Assets is still $200\n\nNet Asset Value of the fund is $200 / share\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the AP need to deliver a basket of shares for AWESOMEETF share creation, does he need to deliver cash as part of the basket?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Since Actively Managed ETFs are only required to disclose their transactions at the end of the day, how does AP know which stocks are part of the basket?",

            "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, February 23, 2021**\n\nThe market was extremely volatile today. After opening deep in the red, the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) was able to reverse to close marginally positive. The sell-off in technology stocks continued, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) once again underperforming. The recent pressure on the market comes after a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield that has market participants concerned that inflation will begin to rise. \n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered his semiannual monetary policy testimony, offering another update on his view for the path forward for monetary policy during and after the pandemic. In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, \"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\" \n\nIn Washington, The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee voted to advance President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion virus relief proposal on Monday, bringing it a step closer to passage ahead of a mid-March cliff, after which federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. \n\nIn the last week or two, market participants have been eyeing a sharp spike in Treasury yields, raising concerns of a surge in borrowing costs and inflationary pressures in the post-pandemic economy. The benchmark 10-year yield hovered around 1.36% for its highest level in a year, after wallowing below 1% for most of 2020. That said, the Treasury yield remains at historically low levels. While we expect the spike in the yield to put pressure on the market, our long-term bull thesis remains intact.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday it would award a multi-billion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh Defense to manufacture a new generation of postal delivery vehicles. Shares of Workhorse (WKHS), another company that was vying for that contract, plummeted more than 40% after the deal was announced.\n* Shares of Snapchat (SNAP) reached all-time highs after the company provided an optimistic outlook on ad revenue and customer growth.\n* Apple (AAPL) is planning to increase dividend according to Chief Executive Tim Cook, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing the shareholder meeting.\n* Facebook said late Monday it will restore news content to its platform in Australia. The company had suspended news sharing last week amid a dispute over a proposed Australian law requiring tech platforms to pay publishers.\n* French antitrust investigators have accused Alphabet Inc's Google of failing to comply with the state competition authority's orders on how to conduct negotiations with news publishers over copyright, two sources who read the investigators' report said.\n* After reaching an all-time high of more than $58,000, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted in the few days\n* **Please note many of the current stock prices were written in the morning and probably changed due to intraday movement.**\n* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by KeyCorp from $290 to $390 at Overweight. Stock currently around $322\n* MongoDB (MDB) target raised by Citigroup from $465 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $380\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target of $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $377\n* SEA (SE) target raised by Cowen from $225 to $350 at Outperform. Stock currently around $250\n* Spotify (SPOT) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $390 to $425 at Buy. \n\n\u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d - Franklin D. Roosevelt",

            "selftext": "I think that two Fidelity ETFs deserve more attention.  Each is under 5 years old with an ER of 0.29%, each had a regularly scheduled rebalance just a day ago (so it's a good time to evaluate holdings), and each makes novel contributions to the factor ETF space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **FCPI, Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF:** [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI)\n\nMethodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf)\n\nDescribed on page 5 of the methods doc, the ETF tracks an index that screens for value, quality, and momentum of stocks (a set of 11 total metrics, which I like for inflation protection due to the emphasis on free cash flow).  However, it also slightly biases sector weights (5% each) depending on historical correlation of sector performance with inflation.  So you get more weight on commodities-centric stocks, fewer tech and consumer discretionary stocks, etc (see page 7 of methods).  Its performance in the past year hasn't been amazing (it has been like VTV), but, inflation concerns did not really ramp up until very recently.  Also, the ETF index was reconstituted effective Monday, February 22 (see methods).  So if it's going to outperform a total market ETF, it's set up for it right now.  This is a small ETF by AUM and volume, so keep an eye on bid/ask spreads if you're dipping into it, but man, super appealing right now!\n\nHaving a look inside, you need to examine the daily holdings document since it was rebalanced more recently than the end-of-January summary holdings.  That's here: [http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N](http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&applicationId=ETF&securityId=316092386&securityIdType=CUSIP&critical=N) .  Top 10 holdings currently include:\n\nAAPL, MSFT, EQT, WMB, EXP, NEM, CC, PG, GOOGL, PM.  Thus, it's heavy on free-cash-flow tech, oil/gas, materials, and consumer staples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **FVAL, Fidelity Value Factor ETF**: [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL)\n\nMethodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR\\_US\\_Value\\_Focus\\_Methodology\\_publicFNL.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR_US_Value_Focus_Methodology_publicFNL.pdf)\n\nMany \"value factor\" ETFs have a near-exclusive focus on price/book ratio and earnings (or sales) to price.  This one is different in that is specifically calls out free cash flow yield and earnings to enterprise value metrics, which are also metrics that DSTL (the \"Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF\", another modern value/quality ETF @ [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl)) weights highly.  In fact, these value metrics are also used as the \"value\" metrics for FCPI. FVAL is not a simple \"value or growth\" classifier like some S&P or CRSP value/growth factor ETFs.  It has consistently outperformed Vanguard's value ETF, VTV, probably as a result of using methods that can better reflect the effects of intangible value.  It was also rebalanced effective Monday, Feb. 22.  I think that this is the sort of ETF that may also outperform the market if meme growth tech stocks stagnate or there is mild inflation.\n\nIts top holdings do include free-cash-flow tech starting with S&P 500 stalwarts AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.  Many \"value\" ETFs will not be holding those tech leaders!  But after that that, FVAL takes a bit of a turn; one thing you won't find in either FVAL or FCPI is Tesla.  But FVAL does have classic value stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway and JNJ in its top 10.\n\nFVAL performance since roughly post-election: [https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VOO,VTV,FVAL&n=70&O=011000](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VOO,VTV,FVAL&n=70&O=011000) or the past 4 years: [https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VOO,VTV,FVAL&n=1008&O=011000](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VOO,VTV,FVAL&n=1008&O=011000)\n\nGeneral Fidelity ETF reports and methods are here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/FidelityIndex/RebalanceSchedules](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/FidelityIndex/RebalanceSchedules)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think of those ETFs or alternatives for a moderately inflationary environment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s.

            "selftext": "Before you downvote: I dont hold a long or short position in any ARK fund or their holdings\n\nThis week has been a bad week for tech and growth stock investors in general. The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.\n\nWell thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.\n\nA lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.\n\nIf ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.\n\nEDIT: I was wrong about TSM. They still have .5% TSM",

            "selftext": "**What is a P/S ratio?** \n\nPrice / Sales ratio. The higher the number, the more expensive the stock is compared to sales.\n\n**What about P/E ratio?** \n\nPrice / Earnings ratio is great for mature companies, but the hottest stocks typically lose money, so P/S is a quick and lazy proxy.\n\n**Got an example?** \n\nTake AAPL's Market Cap of $2113B and TTM sales of $294B. 2113/294=7. So the P/S ratio of AAPL is 7. Is that good or bad? Well it depends on the industry. Typically Apple has a PS ratio of 2-5. APPL had a PS ratio of 7 at the end of 2007, and we all know what happened in 2008, right?\n\n**What does the P/S ratio have to do with anything?**\n\nThere are currently [54 stocks with a PS over 30](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&o=-ps&r=41).\n\nThe stocks with the highest P/S ratio [are getting hit the hardest](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&o=-ps).\n\n**Is having a PS ratio over 30 bad?** \n\nHistorically, anything with a P/S over 30 underperforms as an investment. The revenue growth will outperform, but the overall stock still underperforms, because all that revenue growth was already priced in.  None of the FANG stocks ever exceeded a P/S ratio of 25. MSFT had a PS ratio of about 28 back in 1999, and it took 17 years for the price to recover. \n\n**When was the last time we had this many stocks with a P/S over 30?** \n\nAt the end of 1999 we had 22, making up 6.70% of US market cap. From 2001-2019 we had very few. At the end of 2020 we had 50, making up 4.80% of US market cap. \n\n**How significant is this?** \n\nI don't know, man. 5% of the market is not significant. Also, there isn't a lot of data, only 31 stocks went over a P/S ratio of 30 from 2001-2019 (the other 85 instances occurred in 2000 & 2020.)  Also it's worth noting the valuation of all stocks [has been trending up](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales) because of low rates. Yay?\n\n**What should you do?** \n\nI don't know, man. I am not a broker/ dealer. This is not advice. You can quickly check your individual stocks P/S ratio on [finviz](https://finviz.com/). P/S over 10 is red, which means you should dig deeper.\n\n**Edit:** No I am not implying Apple caused the housing bubble to pop in 2008. Let me be specific. From 2007 to 2008 Apples revenue went up (24b to 32b), earnings went up (3.4b-4.8b), but its stock fell (180-85). During a recession, mr market is less inclined to pay a premium for growth stocks.",

When you look at forward snp500 PE ratios on Yahoo finance or Macrotrends, you are comparing actual forward earnings, to estimated forward earnings. Here is a fun statistic, 80% of snp500 companies beat q4 2020 earnings. Let me emphasize this, \\*\\*forward earnings are always wrong\\*\\*. The deviation varies, but it is not the correct number. In this market condition, we are clearly in a phase where the market is pricing higher than expected 2021 earnings. This may be because of a faster than expected vaccine, more than expected stimulus, or maybe just irrationality\u2026 but it is expecting higher earnings. So when you are comparing historical forward PE to current, it\u2019s not correct.\n\n**Lower interest rates**\\- Yes, this is an obvious narrative that has been pushed by the bulls for months now, but it has some truth to it. Lower interest rates mean a lot of things for companies. They can take on new debt or refinance current debt for lower interest rates, which means more money to invest in themselves for growth, or return more cash flow back to shareholders. Lower interest rates also have an effect on buy and sell-side analyst price targets. When modeling a price target, many analysts use discounted cash flow models or equity risk premiums to discount forward earnings to a present value. When interest rates are lower, the risk-free rate is, obviously, lower, which equates to a lower equity risk premium, hence, a higher price target. What else do higher interest rates mean? More spending from the average consumer. More debt is taken out- which is seen by historically high inflation-adjusted margin in stocks and record new home sales - which leads to more spending, which trickles down to the bottom line for snp500 companies, making trailing twelve-month earnings pretty irrelevant. If comparing historical pe ratios was a science experiment then the price would be a plant, sunlight would be earnings. We would be comparing the growth of plants v sunlight. In this experiment, we would want to keep all other factors constant, like room temperature, time spent exposed to sunlight, amount of soil, etc. But in our funky, weird, irrational, science experiment we are changing the amount of soil (interest rates), and here is the funniest part, people call it investing.\n\n**The makeup of the snp500 companies**\\- Another good reason historical PE ratios really mean nothing is that the quality of earnings has been pretty dramatically increasing. Over the past 7 years, the FANG % share of the snp500 market cap has gone from about 3.5% to around 12%, adding about a 1.7 forward earnings difference attributable to the FANG names. But, even this does not tell the full story. A significant makeup of the snp500 market cap is high growth names- relative to the snp500 earnings growth- not mentioned in that last example. Examples are Tesla, Amazon, Visa, Disney, Nvidia, Mastercard, Paypal, etc\u2026 It\u2019s very easy to justify the snp500\u2019s rather rapid rise of P/E ratio over the last decade by just the quality of earnings. These large-cap companies are taking away business from small, not snp500 companies. Which is a large factor in why the economy suffered in 2020 but Q4 2020 earnings were positive Y/Y. Another key point is that P/E ratios do not tell the full story for many companies. Amazon trades at a 90 PE, Tesla trades at a 1000 PE, Nvidia trades at 70 PE, NFLX 80, PYPL 70. Why? Because they have pretty significant 5-year earnings growth rates.\n\n**The rise of intangibles**\\- Companies are increasingly being valued by assets not realized by GAAP metrics. Intangible assets are one of the reasons price to book value has been a horrible performer the past 10 years. Companies are increasingly spending money on certain technologies that are producing 0 cash flows but will produce serious amounts of cash flow in the future. Let me give a good example. Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated on the 2020 Q4 earnings call \u201cWe are in preliminary talks to license autopilot\u201d. Currently, autopilot is a free option producing 0 cash flow but has required significant CAPEX to create. We know this is an asset to Tesla and will create cash flow into the future. Autopilot, arguably, is producing earnings for the company right now, since it\u2019s a selling point on their main products. But this does not show up on any income statement or balance sheet. This is simply an example to show how GAAP metrics do not do justice to many companies. An example like this can be pulled out of almost any snp500 company. \n\n**Stock buybacks-** SNP500 company\u2019s buybacks basically fell through the floor in 2020. There is a quite obvious reason why this happened, a ton of uncertainty in the economy so companies temporarily suspended stock buybacks. As we all know, stock buybacks artificially increase EPS since the company is retiring shares, just like secondaries artificially decrease EPS since it\u2019s dilutionary. Stock buybacks are expected to not only pick up in 2021 but expected to accelerate to historical highs. Making TTM PE ratio's not telling the full story on stock prices.\n\n**PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS-** This statement is a disclaimer on almost every, 10k, 10q, institutional note, and blog post. But investors seem to take that philosophy and throw it out the window when it comes to price ratios. If you had looked at historical earnings ratios in May 2009, you would have sold all your stocks and crawled under a rock. Since then we have missed the greatest bull market in history. If you would have looked at historical PE\u2019s in 2014, you would have said to yourself, the market is overvalued, I will sell and wait for a dip. Well, in that time, you would have to wait 4 years for a 20% decline and get this, you would be paying a 40% premium, not including dividends gained. A 20 PE ratio today does not mean it won't be 30 in the future. \n\n**A number without context should mean 0 to you-** One of the most well-known philosophies in investing is to not chase yield. A higher yield almost always means higher risk. If it didn\u2019t, everyone would be buying 10% dividend-yielding stocks, not realizing earnings have a higher risk of falling, or maybe debt payments are starting to drown the company, etc. And the same vice versa, nobody is selling Microsoft because it is paying a lower dividend relative to the snp500. MSFT is just a higher quality company with a lower payout ratio. This logic should be applied to PE ratios as well. A low PE ratio should almost be alarming. Stocks like Walgreens or Abbvie trade around 10x forward earnings while Microsoft and Apple trade at around 30x forward earnings. Does this mean we should go and sell MSFT and AAPL to buy WBA and ABBV because it\u2019s a 3x better deal based on pe? No. This is not financial advice saying to buy or sell any of these companies. I'm a fan of all 4 of these companies, I\u2019m just making a point that not contextualizing why these companies have different earnings multiples leaves you ignorant of your investments.",

Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.\n\n\nSecondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.\n\n\nThirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its \"bad\", but obviously it isn't bad.\n\n\nAnother point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.\n\n\nAnother point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.\n\n\nNow check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpg\n\n\nObviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio\n\n\nIts irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.\n\n\n\nSo hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.\n\n\nA correction? Maybe. But who cares, this just slows us down a little. Corrections are healthy and help us avoid a real crash.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the award! :D\n\n\nEDIT2: Corrected the PE ratio for nasdaq",

            "selftext": "I thought it would be beneficial to take a look at technical analysis from an intuitive standpoint. I would say having read a number of materials, things like [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com), even books that proprietary trading firms advocate like Jane Street, various websites, people on youtube, even the CMT coursebooks; the one commonality is that no one starts from a first-principles, axiomatic approach.\n\nWe all have some instinct that elements of technical analysis are valid. I can prove this because we all reference one TA tool or another to gauge sentiment or the strength of prevailing trends. A big one that comes to mind is CNN's Fear and Greed Index. Well, what actually is it? It looks at moving averages of the SPY and VIX to gauge sentiment. My own firm, one of the largest research and i-bank companies that has done some of the biggest recent IPOs in recent years, does a weekly positioning report that does this moving average and relative strength breakdown on a sector-by-sector basis: the very same RSI indicator you can throw on any stock or index on your own.\n\nI start from the premise that **1.** emotions influence trading and investing decisions. **2.** price cannot move up until sell orders have been absorbed. If you can agree with me here, let's proceed.\n\nNow, let's apply this to a concept that everyone has heard of and maybe uses but may not fully understand and from there we'll take a tour through the next extensions of it.\n\n*Why are* ***moving averages*** *significant?*\n\nHow do you feel when you are 50% up on a stock vs. 50% down on a stock? Here it is: they serve as proxies or composite for the **cost basis** of the most recent participants in the stock and give insight into their fragility or strength. We draw that strength or weakness from the other holders. Are people chilling at their entry or is their pain tolerance being tested? If the major moving averages (often the 8, 20, 50, 100, 200, but most critically the 20, 50, and 200) are close together, all that is saying the newest and intermediate entrants' are close together.\n\nYou can take any stock (with long enough price history) and characterize the trend or lack of it by the relations of the moving averages to each other and current price: uptrend (longer-term MAs are trailing the other ones on the way up), obvious downtrend (same thing, but to the downside), or accumulation/consolidation (range-bound. getting close together), or chop (after a volatile move that throws everything off).\n\nEach configuration of MAs paints a different picture of a stock. Say the 20 and 50 are close and you think is poised to run up: but what if the 200 MA is above your entrypoint? That tells you there are still many bagholders waiting to unload on you as soon as they've gone back to breakeven.\n\nCompare that situation to when the 200MA is right down with the 20 and 50: this is meaningfully different because enough time has passed for most of the weaker holders to cry uncle and bow out.\n\n**So in that sense, a bagholder down 50% who has demonstrated unwillingness to sell over many months enduring multiple legs down (aka diamond-handing), is actually identical to a long who got in at the absolute bottom, when the float has been cornered and rally is preparing, in that they are both locking down supply.**\n\nWhat about when the rally occurs? Now when that bagholder sees price hits his entrypoint after a year of seeing paper losses of 50%, what is he going to do? Many of them will sell. You see this rage and anguish everywhere, people eviscerating the stock and praying to get out at breakeven. You've ever experienced this yourself or, if you're brand new to the market, you will soon.\n\nThis is turn influences the long who anticipates this and will at least begin scaling out at that first price target. Again, just look at common threads showing up over and over again. How many times have you seen \"I took some shares off the table, now I'm just letting it ride and playing with house money?\" Again making the point that these common psychological and emotional things affect all of us and these get expressed in relation to key prices.\n\nSo if you accept that bagholders are likely to sell at a sniff of being breakeven again, we can segment the price the stock has traded at into levels. **Hence we naturally arrive at the concepts of support and resistance.**\n\n*Do you believe in mean reversion theory?* Well,  guess what **Bollinger Bands** are premised on. A stock is less likely to sustain a full standard deviation move on nothing. And this is where I want to interject my own personal opinion: these indicators and tools mean nothing without at least paying attention to the big picture. You **contextualize the drop or rise against the catalyst or fundamental change that sparked the move**. Blindly buying on \"Oh Bollinger Band was breached\" or \"RSI is oversold\" is a recipe for disaster. There is no such thing as \"Yeah I just look at the charts, that tells me the news\".\n\nIf we can learn anything from GME, Volkswagen, Sears, JC Penny, **it proves that stocks (the units themselves) are a commodity subject to the law of supply and demand.** So much of TA can be summarized as attempting to characterize the ownership of the float (again stemming from the axiom that price literally cannot move up until the sellers have at least temporarily been absorbed).\n\nThe times where TA will fly out of the window is most often when **float turnover is extremely high (during or several days after some 10x volume day or just extreme moves) and you have no idea how idea where people stand on the stock.** Again, we can relate this to the strength of the longs: the longs that were positioned beforehand have sold and we no longer have clarity into the collective longs' cost basis.  Why? Because this is a completely new batch of longs and weakness has been introduced because people have bought at the top and now the process starts over again. In this confusion the stock gaps up 15% one day, then gaps down 15% the next, then gaps up 20%, like ATOS now for one example of many. All we know is that extreme volatility is here, but we don't need to look at any indicator to tell us that.\n\nAnd I believe technical analysis is **not great for penny stocks.** Not because they lack analytical power or that you can't pinpoint entrypoints, but because they cannot predict the random targeting or so-called bear raids by either proprietary trading firms, hedge funds or private syndicates. All they need to do is determine the company is not a buyout candidate, is not close to securing major contracts or going to market with their developing product, that's literally all they need to decide to short the stock. And they'll do it even if it's a decorated group of C-level execs with contacts that you would think makes it risky because of the potential for some partnership or contract, because they just want to ride it down for a couple weeks or months. Even if institutions hold 20% of the float and people take reassurance in this, 20% of say 300M or even 500M is nothing. And when you look at the average daily volume on some for these thinner stocks, even one individual trader or group of them can have enough capital to mess with the stock if he wants to and paint the entire day, much less just the close. I also do not like to apply TA to **SPACs** when they are just out of the gate as they are vulnerable to short reports by hedge funds like Citron, Point72, Hindenberg, who want to hit the stock before institutional holders have taken positions. We also have little price history to work with.\n\nSome of my personal advice: **you should never rely on an indicator blindly, and you should always understand how they are formulated.** A MACD cross below and above the zero-line are two completely different things. A lot of them are formulated off of the open, day, and close, of a particular day, and some like Accumulation/Distribution may give a false impression because they don't account for gap downs or gap ups. So you have to take the time to understand the tools you are using. I personally stopped using volume indicators because we do not have dark pool information and I just never got in touch with someone who could explain it to me.\n\n**Get a big picture of what's going on beyond the TA.** I'm choosing to end on this opinion because it's important to me. Don't play a penny stock and hold it after it jumps 100% overnight expecting it to continue running, and then get diluted on because you didn't realize they only had cash on hand for three more quarters, is -a billion EPS, and they have an open shelf registration, or you held a stock into the strike price of warrants, that you didn't know about because you didn't spend 1 minute glancing at finviz (current ratio will you give a quick idea they likely the company is to do a secondary offering; just using common sense, they're not going to wait till the very last day before issuing shares for more cash, right?) or the shareholder's equity section of the balance sheet (to know if warrants will be at play).\n\nThis happened specifically multiple times to me before I got tired of seeing 100% overnighters dump down to 20% gain before I finally decided \"You know what, I'm going to spend literally 1 minute to save myself thousand of dollars.\" Another way of saying this is to \"**Have a plan**\", and be educated enough to have one.\n\nThose are two concrete examples of things that take 1 minute to look up, that I didn't do and lost thousands in paper gains because of it. I still have those trade confirmations saved (OPTT, TRXC, a couple more), and will never delete them because of how painful, at a time where as a new college grad making not a lot it would have meaningfully changed my life. And so they can serve me as reminders  that there is no such thing as a free lunch: anytime you try and be lazy, the market will expose and punish you. Actually **write down** your entry and exit conditions. None of any of this matters is if you don't do that. It does not matter if you get 80% of all your trades right if that 5th trade undoes everything you did right.",

            "selftext": "So, right now, you might be asking yourself \"Fuck Robinhood. Where should I, [Timmy from Charlotte](https://discord.com/channels/290856853204631552/290856853204631552/804689999407874070), move my account? Fuck Robinhood. How do I get away from Citadel? Fuck Robinhood. What is going on? Fuck Robinhood.\" I'm not 100% sure where this post is going so I can't promise I'll answer any of those questions but my goal here is still coherent conversation so maybe someone else might have those answers in the comments. Idk.\n\n## What is Citadel and what do they do?\n\n[A hedge fund wrapped up with an advisory service, an execution venue, a market maker, an IPO partner, a ~~sandwich shop~~, etc.](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/). Such megacorps pay firms fractions of a cent to pass each order through them for execution. The more orders the brokerage passes along, the more they're paid. Money is involved because the more orders that pass through a particular execution venue first, the faster they can make decisions about the direction of the market on both the micro and macro scale. This is the current nature of the market. Order data for 'new' and 'small' traders using self-directed firms has been especially valuable the last 20 years because you do things institutions cannot. You can open a new position based on a tweet while the major advisory services need to whip out the scales and weigh the cost of moving assets for countless customers at once and that's even further complicated if they're designated fiduciaries because, in their book, reacting quickly implies that there's unknown risks involved. For example, they did the numbers on a particular company six months ago and decided it wouldn't be profitable in another six months. Even in 2021, they just can't move as fast as you but knowing what you're doing is a step closer to them being able to respond sooner with smaller changes rather than react with major changes when shit hits the fan. (BTW, the fatal flaw on $GME is that they tried to play the old 'cull the weak' game that worked for them for decades and absolutely chose to ignore the direction the market was moving until it was too late. If they'd used the order flow and other data they're paying so much cash to access and were as bright as they imagine they are, it would have been rough but even hardcore shorts could have lived through this week. Retail investors can pat themselves on the back for exploiting it but Melvin Capital got fucked by hubris and lack of awareness.)\n\nNot to get all RZA between songs on it but that's why the title of this sub has been '[Welcome to the machine!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Machine)' for a long time now. The major players know you dream of making it big, buying a car, having a steak, and all the other things Roger wrote about, just by doing something you enjoy (playing guitar but it could be your art, you talents in math or science, taps in a mobile game, or in this instance investing) and they'll welcome you in with open arms, convince you that they'll be a guide and there to help, knowing they'll get a cut just by letting you do what you do and finding a way to package it. People over simplify it with \"if the service is free, you are the product\" because they don't notice that the machine will also make you pay if it can. Money for order flow has made it easier for others to provide the space for you to do what you do without noticing they're cashing in even if you don't but don't forget that the machine can be other investors. The machine can be the large firms. The machine can be investment advice columnists. Hedge funds and brokerages aren't the only 'machine operators' in the financial industry.\n\n## Which firms use Citadel and which ones don't?\n\nThey all use Citadel.\n\nI'm not joking, I've kept up to date on execution venues (people probably thought I was just lecturing them about understanding order flow here but I dislike Virtu as a venue and Apex as a clearing firm which I've talked about here for years) and the concentration of orders being fed to the short list of venues has not changed in a positive way because that's where the money is. The idea for this post came to me this morning because no news article, no TV interview, and not a single hot take on Twitter I've read so far has managed to mention just how embedded Citadel individually is in the modern market. I had AOC's live stream on in the background last night and even the guests seemed to imply that Citadel is a little firm propping up Robinhood and that nobody could have seen this blowing up one day. These relationships (even down to how much money is paid) are public by law. Every quarter, both sides are required to release data on order flow in 605 (raw), and 606/607 reports.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of places I could come up with off the top of my head that use Citadel as their primary or secondary execution venue and what percentage of orders for S&P 500 listed securities they recently sent through Citadel:\n\nFirm | Market orders % | Marketable\\* limit orders %\n----|-------------|------------\n[e*Trade](https://content.etrade.com/etrade/powerpage/pdf/q1-606a.pdf) | 36.33 | 37.16\n[Schwab](https://content.schwab.com/drupal_dependencies/psr/606/2020-Q4-Schwab-Quarterly-Report.pdf) | 31.61 | 30.06\n[TDA](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q4-2020.pdf) | 60.04 | 59.25\n[Edward Jones](https://www.edwardjones.com/disclosures/account-features-terms/equities/order-execution-routing.html) | 36.91 | 47.49\n[Webull](http://public.s3.com/rule606/webull/606-WBUL-2020Q3.zip) |  50.85 | 53.71\n[Interactive Brokers](https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr606Reports/IBKR_606a_2020_Q3.pdf) | 25.34 | 11.24\n[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargoadvisors.com/pdf/order-routing-606/2020q3-wret-606.pdf) | 35.02 | 32.85\n[Firsttrade](http://d4l0yihtmj3iw.cloudfront.net/forms/en-us/routing_reports/routing_report_2020q4.pdf) ^#| 0.95 | 0.60 \n[TradeStation](https://uploads.tradestation.com/uploads/2020-Q3-SEC-Rule-606-607.pdf) | 28.14 | 26.90\n[ally](https://www.ally.com/resources/pdf/invest/order-routing/3rd-quarter-2020-606-report.pdf)| 40.15 | 44.76 \n[Robinhood](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf) | 50.82 | 50.24\n[Alpaca](https://files.alpaca.markets/disclosures/library/SEC+606a1+-+2020Q3.pdf) ^$ | 11.07 | 3.31\n[IEX](https://iextrading.com/regulation/605/) ^% | N/A | N/A\n[Fidelity](https://clearingcustody.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/9901330.html)| 52.28 | 45.09\n[Apex clearing](http://public.s3.com/rule606/apex/606-APEX-2020Q3.zip) ^@ | 40.97 | 42.76\n[Wealthfront](https://mta.ihsmarkit.com/app-v2/public-report-library/public-report-library-view/Wealthfront%20Inc/355) | 100 | 50.01\n[Tastyworks](https://assets.tastyworks.com/production/documents/sec_rule_606_report_q4_2020.pdf) | 59.97  | 61.18\n\n\\* Marketable limit orders are those that immediately have a chance of executing against the current spread\n\n^# Firsttrade is predominantly a dark pool only sending orders away when they require liquidity\n\n^$ Alpaca is an API-first firm which I like and talk about on Discord sometimes because I wish RH would open their API but they're still backed by Apex which I dissuade everyone from getting involved with because Penson Financial Services.\n\n^% IEX is a closed loop exchange that internally clears orders among customers (great source for free order data to test algos)\n\n^@ Apex is the clearing agent for many smaller firms including Public.com, Betterment, Acorns, M1, Rize, Stockpile, Stash,  \n\nNow, when you look at that list, remember three things:\n\n - that 99.9% of the remaining orders are going to [Wolverine](https://www.tradewex.com/), [Virtu](https://www.virtu.com/), [2 Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), and other hedge fund adjacent venues for execution\n\n - brokerages were doing the same back when they were also charging commissions. I don't feel firms being paid for order flow is inherently wrong but whatever agreement Citadel has in place to force firms to act in Citadel's best interest over customers and even over the brokerage's own best interest is difficult to wrap my mind around right now. Which brings me to my next point...\n\n - Citadel's most loyal sources for order flow (Robinhood, TDA, Webull, and IB) all fell in line and limited trading at least part of the day. The agreements between these companies and Citadel are obviously not public but I'm sure Citadel has them bent over a contractual barrel that left them with no choice but to comply. As a customer of half of those firms, I say they should have done whatever they could to explain the **actual** situation to the public (spoilers: it wasn't risk on the retail side), taken whatever penalties Citadel could impose for ignoring them (all the way up to breach of contract, etc), and fight *that* out in court rather than act in ways that seems to have only punished and confused customers. Corporate level decision making is so fucking stupid.\n\n## Where to go?\n\n[Fino](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuck_if_I_know).\n\nIf IEX was larger, that would be a decent alternative for equities but they don't have a silly app that looks good in screenshots but tells you nothing useful. I can't think of a self-directed firm that can currently exist without Citadel and the rest. If you do, post about it, I guess.\n\n## More things I for sure do not know...\n\n...but hope someone wants to talk about.\n\n - I don't know shit about the legality of anything that has gone on this week with Robinhood and no, I will not be a part of any lawsuit because I was not effected by what happened because I don't have any options or equity holdings in Robinhood and cannot claim damages. Stop asking me.\n\n - I'm not even sure if splitting corporations up anti-trust style would work for this. For sure, it was Citadel's vested interest that cascaded down to firms and then users but I don't know of any cases that forced divestiture on that scale. Hedge funds with cases in a friendly district could make a valid claim that they cannot function without access to both order data and current assets. It'll be interesting to see if anything changes over the next few years and how.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nDoxxing myself more and more but I worked for a market analytics/quantitative research firm in the city that was eventually gobbled up by Virtu. I'd moved abroad months earlier anyway but we loved that job and they only wanted the algos we'd designed so fuck Virtu.\n\nMy current day job makes trading public companies complex (which is why I only talk about algotrading ETH on Discord). Most of my self-directed play money is still with TDA (haven't made a trade there or on RH in almost three years) but the majority of my family's assets, my retirement, my kid's inheritances and college funds, and on and on have been handled by GS for nearly two decades and likely will continue to be even after I return to the private sector. Now, what would be sweet is if Goldman Sachs would extend their investment arm ([which sends orders directly to exchanges](https://www.goldmansachs.com/compliance/Rule606/GSCO_606_Q3_2020.20201019135909.pdf)) to the general public like they have with their Marcus savings accounts. If they could devise a way to legally pass a good percentage of all (would be dependent on volume of the security, etc.) orders directly to the floor as a bundle, they'd break even at best on it but that would actually 'democratize the market.'",

I am not a ~~cat~~ financial advisor\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe, in a time like this, a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water...\n\n# Splashed right into their faces.\n\nTl;dr Ape explanation: I want GME to moon, but I am concerned about people being fed false information. 1. The claim Melvin said they didn't close their short position at the hearing is a lie. Their opening statement specifically had them saying they DID close it. 2.  The strategy of ITM calls boosting the price was tested last time & failed last time. These are covered calls. 3. There isn't enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding. The profit comes when HF close positions, but you won't know that happened until it's over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love to see GME rocket to the moon. And I believe there is a scenario where that can be possible. But I want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing THEY are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon. This is not a bear post against GME. This is reality.\n\n* This is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last GME wave.\n* This is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time (me, included) and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back.\n* This is for those of you who just didn't learn your lesson, and need a reminder of what went down last time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, there are scenarios where GME can be squeezed. But what scenario is that? And what scenarios are not that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. First thing first, I want to stop a lie that I have seen spread like wildfire. The blatant lie that Melvin Capital, during the Gamestop hearing, admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop. This is not true. Now, I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie, did it as a *valiant* effort to help boost the price of Gamestop, and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS, because nobody else decided to waste their time, watching a 5+ hour congressional hearing about stocks. Those are about the two most boring things in the world, combined. But, you don't even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is. In Melvin Capital's opening statement, within the first minute of it, they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it. You can look up videos of the opening statements, yourself. I won't baby you that much. So, in conclusion, don't rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions. It's a lie and it needs some water doused on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Scenario Two, possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday/Friday: \"Keeping the price over **(insert dollar amount here),** by Friday close, makes **(insert number here)** of calls ITM, and when they cover, the price is going to rocket!\" Now, I am not going to say this scenario is impossible, but it is not very likely, and it is what got many people burned the last time. Yes, it is true, keeping the price over a certain price, making a lot of calls ITM, can be good for the stock... **IF** those calls aren't covered calls, which I believe that almost all of them are. The week ending Jan. 22nd, there are probably a lot of naked calls. That hurt the sellers, bad, when GME closed at a very high price. Nobody expected it. That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike. But then, let's run down what happened that following week. Yes, RH restricted buying on Thursday, 28th, which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed, but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the \"Calls ITM\" strategy that followed. That Thursday, the price plummeted into the $200s. That Friday, you heard a lot of chatter of ***\"As long as we can get the stock up to $310, a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden, my fellow apes! Get it to $320 and that's bonus points. That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover. That's 9 MILLION SHARES!\"*** And yeah, A lot of that was true. There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above $320. And you know what we did? We closed above $320. We closed around $328, in fact. This was it. Come Monday, that price was going to the moon. *\"10k isn't a meme!\"* We chanted. We couldn't be wrong. We did the maths. We had the DD. Diamonds don't crack, baby! Well, come Monday, there was no lift off. It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again. The stock fell, and it fell hard. Going back into the low $200s, dipping into the $100s even, before closing in the $200s. That's okay though. That's fine. They had until Wednesday to *actually* close on those Calls, you'd hear. So Tuesday came and went. Then Wednesday too. We never saw $300 again. In fact, by Friday, we were barely even seeing $100. So what happened? What went wrong? We had maths **AND** anime on our side. Well, what I believe happened is, those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan. 22nd, when they got screwed. They didn't let their calls be naked the following week. They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week, if they didn't already have them. This allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under, making them the big winners in all of this. But that meant these weren't NEW stocks that would help us go higher. No, these were stocks bought on the way up. They helped us peak but wouldn't help us go ***over*** the peak. So, when those calls executed, there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock. Holders who saw their stocks were worth $300-$320. These weren't diamond handers, like you or I. These apes wanted their bananas ***NOW.*** So they sold when they got them. Gotta cash in those profits at some point. As WSB loves saying \"*You can't lose if you don't sell\"*. Well, you also can't win if you don't sell. So now flash forward a month later, and the same theory is being pushed. \"*Keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come Monday. No, scratch that, $1000. No, wait, even better. $69,420!\"* You hear in the echo chamber, bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open. That's not going to happen. These are covered calls that are ITM. You're not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price. You are just buying stocks for $50-$100 that were already bought at $40-$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant. And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time. So, do not rely on this strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Scenario Three: *\"tHeY hAvE tO cOveR. tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE\"*. This is probably the most ignorant reason, and is why I typed it out like that. Yeah, I'm mocking you. Get over it. it is true, they do have to cover eventually. But not with your stocks. GME short interest is somewhere around 45-50% (too lazy to relook up the actual number), and this is after new reports showed 1.3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday. Now, yes, that is a high amount of short interest. But that isn't high enough for the **\"Diamond Hands\"** approach. There's still 50ish percent of shares out there, not shorted. And yes, Diamond Handers hold a lot of those, most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money, not the message. They see a 3x profit? They sell. They sell to whoever is willing to buy. Could be more Diamond Handers, could be hedge funds. But eventually, Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with. That's when the Hedge Funds can swoop in, buy up these stocks, cover their short positions. The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers, and end up selling to more Hedge Funds. When the short interest is only around 50%, you can't win with the Buy/Hold strategy. When the short interest is 50%, the short squeeze happens and you don't know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered. You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top. That's the end of your ride. The ride doesn't just keep going up. You can only set the price when you own most of the market, and in this case, we don't. And on top of all of that, you also have people who are doing this with their bill money. The 1st of the month is coming up, that's a lot of rent needing paid. No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills. But, that's more shares that will flood the market. Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there, but pennies add up to dollars eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning. Again, I cannot stress this enough: I **DO** believe a short squeeze can happen with GME. But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen. I'm just tired of seeing people being fed these these  delusional optimistic claims that throw truth, history, and **REAL** DD & common sense out the window, treating GME more like a pump n dump than an actual short squeeze.  it's okay to drink the Kool-aid, but maybe check to make sure it isn't spiked first.",

            "selftext": "I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.\n\nHere is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.\n\n[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \\- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  \n[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \\- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security\u2019s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.\n\n[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \\- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.\n\n[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \\- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.\n\n[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \\- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a \"cloud\" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.\n\n[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \\- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.\n\nMA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.\n\nPivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.\n\nSAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.\n\nSuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",

I sold at the top today and then wanted to buy back in at the bottom but forgot about a little thing called wash sales. That being said when I purchased at 147 my cost basis was actually showing at \\~250. Now, this is just for tax purposes however it was factored into margin and completely eliminated me from other trades and would have kept me sidelined for quite some time. I made the decision to close my position entirely and put a large sum of my capital into ACTC which will be my next DD. Sadly, I need to wait 30 days for the wash sale to wear off before I could re-enter GME. This bars me from participating in any upcoming squeezes without substantial risk and it prevents me from entering a long position prior to the 3/25 Earnings Report. This is very sad news indeed. However, I am extremely interested in what is happening and will continue monitoring the situation. I might play options although they are entirely to hard to predict, but I will be re-entering as soon as the wash sale wears off.\n\nSide note: I am feeling better but not well enough to film, so for those who have been waiting for videos this week I do apologize, I will have content coming out as soon as I am able to record.\n\n**So let's talk about today**\n\nWell, if you read my last DD (Part 4) today went exactly as expected all the way up until the end. There was one crucial part I missed and that was the top of the downward channel which was $170. I kept mentioning $200 as an important number but completely disregarding the top of the channel. \n\nAlright, so pre-market kind of went sideways and that seemed to bode well for us. At open we saw a massive dip, my prediction was that this would be a sell-off of profit taking and bag holders leaving with their original investment. I still maintain that belief. We found the bottom at around $102 which was impressive to me so the following bounce seemed natural. We had several halts along the way and I want to clarify to everyone that this is completely normal.\n\nHalting trades happens for those of us who can't be behind a computer at all times. It gives us a moment to catch up and make our decision. It also prevents a price from plummeting due to panic selling as it essentially pauses the trade to let people calm down and orders hold off for a second. It works well in the opposite direction to prevent FOMO from kicking in and prices rising to irrational heights quickly. \n\nI think a majority of the price action today was a combination of poorly positioned shorts covering and FOMO for a second squeeze. That in conjunction we scalpers and day traders, I think we simply had a lot of people playing this for profits on this push which gave us the volume and buying power we needed to surpass certain levels. \n\nWe tested a few places on the way up, and some of those tests were rejected. The volume was able to push us through after 1-3 attempts. However, we met with the top of the channel, the $170 mark and at that point, we had no more gas, we had no more volume. We simply couldn't break through, there was a false break which brought us to the days high, but not enough to truly break out. If we did break it we would have been met by the massive sell wall at $200 which we surely would not have had the volume to break. We then were completely exhausted and were forced down significantly. In short, today was not our day.\n\nThere is a silver lining, even with AH we somehow ended up finishing over $106. This gives me hope. Let's immediately hop into what comes next.\n\n**So...what comes next?**\n\nAll of the catalysts mentioned in Part 4 are still in effect, this has not changed. There are still many shorts sitting above $200 and some probably opened positions on the way down again. \n\n**Tomorrow** there is something still interesting to me. The fact that we ended over $100 and options expire tomorrow makes me thing there is still gas in this rocket to go for a second push tomorrow. No bears, no one really, could have expected this to close over $100 today, so a lot of calls are dangerously ITM. Tomorrow will be an all out assault for sure to try to drive the price as low as possible prior to the options expiring. Not only will this assault need to be dealt with, but nothing has changed with the $170 channel ceiling or the Wall of Troy at $200. Be warned folks, this is a battle. It is winnable, but a battle indeed. \n\nWithout a known catalyst, this will be *extremely* difficult to win. Many things could happen, from whales jumping in to last minute news such as Cohen being named CEO (a leading theory regarding Ryan Cohen's mysterious tweet). \n\nTomorrow, I expect the opposite reaction from today. Before I elaborate I would like to remind everyone: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I a wizard. I could be completely wrong about all of this. So please, do your research, make your decisions. Don't base your financial choices off of my one opinion. \n\nI digress, I expect an opposite reaction tomorrow with all the diamond handed apes riding whales screaming war cries in their final push before entering the gates of Valhalla. So I expect a massive run-up right at open. The question is...will it be enough? **Pay close attention to volume tomorrow and pay close attention to important resistance points we say today: 135, 152,155, 170.**\n\nIf volume low, that means everyone is waiting for everyone else to do something; this is assuredly a losing strategy. There will need to be a significant amount of volume to break through the first wall at 135. Hold on.\n\nTo make this more clear it is actually good to think of this like war. Imagine volume as the number of troops you have and imagine each resistance point as a gate you are storming. If you don't have the troops (volume) to break through the first gate (resistance point), you will need to regroup (consolidate) and try again. But each of these attempts uses more and more troops (volume), which means less (troops) to fight break through the following gates (resistance points).\n\nSo pay attention to volume and pay attention to resistance points and how many attempts you are taking to break each one. Without a general (a catalyst/whale) this will be a very difficult and potentially bloody battle tomorrow. \n\nFrom the oppositions perspective, they have two options. They could either bring troops out to meet you (try to force the price down right at open) or they can sit behind their gates and hold the line (bull trap). As I mentioned before, my guess is they will bull trap, why? Because that's what I would do. If we knew you couldn't break the 170 resistance on the first attempt with your whole army, why would we be concerned about reaching it with less troops? Again, volume is key to monitor.\n\nIf you see low volume + sharp price increase, it is likely the bull trap I am expecting, so have buy orders ready to go near resistance points and don't waste your resources trying to climb to them. \n\nIf you see high volume + sharp price increase, then they probably sent troops out to meet you but you are winning.\n\nIf you see low volume + sharp price decrease, then it seems your reinforcements haven't arrived and you will need a miracle to save you.\n\nIf you see high volume + sharp price decrease, then they are winning.\n\nIf you are driven back then at least you are driven to reinforcements (IE: If the price is sent downward then it will be a good buying opportunity for more people to jump in and help the fight). Again, volume here is key. If you see a bounce back, make sure the volume is high enough to justify it, otherwise you are charging back into battle without enough reinforcements and will certainly lose. \n\n**After Tomorrow**\n\nUntil April I see potential for a squeeze, one even larger than the first. But every day that passes, every micro-squeeze in between weakens our side. Play it smart. Sell at what you think is the top, buy back in at the bottom. Rinse. Repeat. This gives each person more and more capital on every attempt. Placing buy orders around the resistance points to help break down the gates is essential. I want to clarify here, the only people who should be playing this are ones who are long on GME to begin with. At some point, this will all settle down, come back to Earth and you will be left with a lot of shares (especially if you keep selling and re-entering). \n\nThe reason this works is because it's literally exactly what the shorts want. **The shorts want a short squeeze.** Yeah see, I said it. Everyone on every side is profiting on this phenomenon aside from the few casualties (bag holders) caught in the crossfire. They drive the price down by shorting it, then they cover to help trigger the short squeeze. You all ride it on the way up allowing them to open new very favorable positions not possible on other stocks and they ride it back down. The cycle continues. \n\nThis is going to be the unfavored opinion, but the notion of diamond handing it til death isn't a winning tactic unless you have the capital to continue adding at the bottom. To win the war, that capital must be generated and what better way than this infinite game of profitable yo-yo?\n\n**Diamond handing worked when there was 226% short interest and that is no longer the case.** \n\n**Diamond handing does not force a short squeeze, it only did the first time due to these conditions.** \n\n**Diamond handing worked because the shorts would be screwed if there was no one to buy their shares anymore, this is no longer reality. People are willing to sell their shares, if the price action doesn't convince you of that I don't know what will.** \n\nThere is only one way to force a short squeeze. **Power.** Buying power that is. \n\nAgain, I am not giving advice. This is my perspective and how I think a squeeze is possible WITHOUT a catalyst. \n\n**TL;DR:** I am not a spreader of FUD, I am a realist. If you are going to continue playing GME then you should find a way to profit from it. Volume is key. Important prices are: 135, 150, 155, 170, 200. The potential for tomorrow squeezing certainly exists with us finishing off at $106. They would have needed to send it much lower to make this be over. However, without a catalyst it will be a difficult battle indeed. This very well may have been the second squeeze, but as I mentioned in Part 4, I don't expect it to be the last one if it is, in fact, over.\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, I am bullish on GME, this is a risky trade, thanks for reading.\\*",

We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, **obviously not as elaborative as today**..\u201d.\n\nHe goes on to say that this **creates a recuring data business for BB**. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckensey&Co report outlined (see my summary) connected cars (the new iPhone) will **allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars**. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.\n\n**Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:**\n\n1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the \u201cplumbing\u201d or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)\n2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things\n\nPer Frost & Sulliven report, a comprehensive endpoint-based security platform should be able to protect against 97% of cyberthreats (attacks). Per F&S, BB can currently protect up to 96% of all cyberthreats **and secure ALL IoTs endpoints.** Possible endpoints (Cars, Phones, Computers, Smart-Appliances, Drones, Smart cities, etc). Its easy to see why Amazon would partner with BB, as another reddit user pointed out, Drones being the most interesting one. By the way, John Chen also mentions Drones in a different interview.\n\n**What does Amazon provide BB:**\n\n1. AWS experience with user interfaces\n2. AWS Cloud\n3. Machine learning models from AWS Management Console\n\nCompetition\n\nChen points out that he is not worried about **Apple and Google** entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and **lack experience in the OEM space with the ecosystems**.\n\nAnother important distinction is that **Ivy allows** OEMs to \u201cown their customer,\u201d Google/Apple may not allow that to happen as they want to own the data. **\u201cBB is only transporting the data\u201d** **to the OEMs**. If you\u2019re an OEM and you understand the value of data, would you choose an OS that lets you own the data or an OS that keeps it for itself..\n\nBB really has a unique opportunity in front of them, the **automotive space is rapidly changing** and 2023-2025 is going to look a lot different than it does now. BB already is in 175 million cars and 61% of the EV market already use QNX. Side note, Lucid motors is also using QNX, they are currently hiring a QNX developer for what that is worth.

However, I have received a large volume of messages regarding part 4 and my analysis, so here it is.\n\nFirst, let's address something that I find very misleading: \"this happened on absolutely no news\"\n\nWell, that simply isn't true. I will mention some key things that led up to this point and would like to also quickly mention the 3-day rule. If ER is bad, you follow the 3 day rule meaning you give it 3 days to bleed before it begins to recover. This is the same for the news cycle. Even the first squeeze when Cohen was announced to be joining the board, it took several days before the market react.\n\nOk, so let's talk news. \n\n1. We have passed the first potential catalyst which was the first GME hearing [which unfortunately, was filled with useless information](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/lnkmrn/gamestop_gme_short_squeeze_congressional_hearing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n2. Another catalyst I mentioned was today, the short interest report that was post Jan. 28th spike. [Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) is reporting 60% and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) is reporting 24%. Again, the discrepancy between the two is simply based on a calculation difference using a different float. One is including synthetic longs while the other is not. This is the first mention I could find regarding the [XRT discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/) and how shorts may have actually essentially moved their positions into an ETF that includes GameStop. At this point, there are so many moving parts and distrust, I'm having trouble assessing what the true short interest might be. Regardless, even if we use the 24% figure and respect that to be true, [this is still considered very high.](https://www.powercycletrading.com/what-is-a-high-short-interest-ratio/#:~:text=Regardless%2C%20most%20options%20traders%20would,above%2020%25%20is%20extremely%20high)\n3. Following [iborrowdesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) we can also see a significant amount of new short positions opening over the past several days, probably an attempt to short the stock but without it being reported in todays numbers.\n4. Chamath also expressed anger regarding how the Congressional hearing went and followed it up with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1363571801289154560). I personally believe Chamath was one of the several large buy orders today.\n5. Ryan Cohen also [tweeted one of his infamous emoji tweets](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289). Now, I'm not going to bother to attempt to decipher it, but when he Tweets, GME spikes much like when Elon tweets about Doge, it spikes. \n6. The [GameStop CFO \"resigns\"](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/23/tech/gamestop-cfo-resigns/index.html#:~:text=New%20York%20(CNN%20Business)%20After,his%20roles%20on%20March%2026) which later news indicates he didn't really willingly resign. This is extremely bullish as GameStop continues to make changes. If the company was losing money for years and the man in charge of money was just fired, this is a *good* thing.\n7. [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/)\n\n**Ok, now let's discuss some of these things**\n\n1. The GameStop hearing was simply a joke. The next hearing will paint a more clear picture regarding data as the SEC, FINRA, and potentially, the DTCC will be present.\n2. Let's talk short interest. As I have mentioned in previous parts, I have no doubt that original shorts have covered and new shorts have entered. A clear battle I have had in the comments is a lot of individuals seem to believe that shorts only re-opened their positions at the top and that's it. I couldn't disagree with this more. The narrative of GME being a dying brick and mortar company is alive and well, and shorts will continue opening positions all the way down. We saw many new positions open today when it was around $50. There are shorts everywhere, and they completely doubt this company and everyones willingness to hold and continue purchasing more, both for retailers and institutions. \n3. Chamath, Cohen, and DFV was a much needed intervention which brought back excitement and truthfully, they probably purchased more shares themselves. \n\n**Sorry had to take a bathroom break, like I said I'm feeling very unwell and apologize that this isn't quite as good as my other posts.**\n\n**Let's talk about what happened today**\n\nI believe today was a gamma squeeze with shorts in the worst positions having to cover. I concur with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/) regarding the gamma squeeze and how it started the domino effect. \n\nI predicted that a large sum of shorts were sitting just over $200 and the AH action helps bolster that claim. We saw the price touch $200 for a moment and then get swatted down like it was a gnat. They absolutely do not want it to break the $200 mark.\n\n**But onto the important part, my predictions as to what comes next**\n\nNow, I'm about to say something very silly but the reason is I want you to make your own decision on what the most likely outcome is.\n\nTomorrow, either the price will come plummeting down, or it will rise to new, extraordinary heights.\n\n1. Reason for it to shoot down: There are a lot of bagholders, a lot of individuals who are simply trying to escape with at least their money back. Depending on pre-market, we could expect a large sell off at open as people reclaim their losses. This sell-off will induce a panic sell that causes everyone to exit in an attempt to mitigate as many losses as possible.\n2. Reason for it to shoot up: There are a lot of bagholders...who won't be satisfied by just breaking even and will refuse to exit until it breaks $1000-$2000. Depending on pre-market there will also be a lot of people who missed the first run have less doubt in their mind for a potential second run. FOMO and sheer buying power will continue to drive the price upward.\n\nBoth of these are considering retail investors only, although the ATH price action compared to volume suggests there are significant amounts of institutional and \"large whale\" buyers getting in on the action. They both are also dependent on pre-market so let's talk about that for a moment.\n\n**Pre-Market**\n\nWhile institutional buyers don't necessarily need retail for this to work, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have reinforcements, so I think they won't begin a bull run until the market opens and retail investors have a final chance to double down while new investors have a chance to purchase their tickets. \n\nHowever, if they seemingly don't care and want to buy as soon as able then we will test that $200 resistance. If that is broken...this is going to be absolutely wild. The domino effect will continue upward chasing the shorts who entered at the very top. It would be wise for these shorts to cover prior to it reaching them as they could still take profits and walk away with a significant sum of money. This will propel the price extremely high at which point nearly all shorts would have exited. \n\n**During Trading Hours**\n\nAgain, completely dependent on pre-market, but I still expect a decent sell-off in the beginning of the day as bagholders escape with breaking even happily. If we open above the $200 mark and the selloff does not appear to be driving us below, I expect the shorts who entered their to cover and this reaches parabolic heights.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nWell, I first want to talk about the infinite squeeze notion. I agree with the sentiment but not for the same reasons most users post about. Here's the thing, everyone still considers GME to be a dying brick and mortar retailer aside from few longs such as myself. That narrative is slowly changing as more and more individuals start to see the significant changes being made within the company. So long as this mentality lives on...so does repetition.\n\nI expect this squeeze to conclude sometime this week, perhaps even tomorrow. What's unique here is we have all now lived through the first one and we will make decisions accordingly, IE taking profits or covering earlier. \n\nBut on the way back down....shorts will open new positions....again. \n\nA new catalyst will arrive....again.\n\nAnd we will squeeze...again.\n\nI'm not sure how many times this will happen, but I think after 3/25 ER when Cohen globally explains the changes being made and the plans for the company, the narrative will begin to change on GME's business. Until the narrative changes, I expect shorts to continue re-entering at dangerous positions. $50 sounds like a fantastic place to short if you believe this is a dead company, but the market sentiment is changing rapidly on the potential of this company. Once shorts are only entering at ridiculously high numbers, then we will finally see the end of the GME saga. \n\nI think a second squeeze will be evidence enough to shorts to not enter at such low numbers, however, greed and doubt goes a long way. So it's very possible this is the final squeeze, but I'm not holding my breath. I will address how I plan on playing this in the next section, but first, some price targets.\n\nSo long as we break the $200 resistance, we will have many short positions above that level that will close to avoid getting caught in the red as well as gamma squeeze mechanics at play. That being said, I could see $500 being possible as early as tomorrow. Now the top is so difficult to predict because one of the largest factors is the most unpredictable; the people. Many people were burned by GME and many others have serious FOMO. If there is large volume, then that will be my indicator that people are piling in all over again. If this is the case, I see $1-$2k being possible. If bagholders simply want to exit and take their money back then I think $500 might be the dream peak. \n\n**So whats your play Hooman?**\n\nWell, as I have said before I am long on GME. So I will be trimming on the way up and leaving some just in case it continues to parabolic heights. I will then re-enter when I believe we hit the bottom which I feel confident starting to re-enter at $70 adding more on the way down. I will then hold tight for another potential squeeze and repeat this process until finally, the GameStop narrative has changed and I could leave my shares along for several years. \n\n**Again, I do apologize** \n\nI know this isn't quite as good as my previous posts, but I wanted to update everyone who was asking me to provide them with my analysis. Part 5 will be coming regardless of what happens tomorrow as I stated numerous times, I don't think this story is anywhere near over, not until April do I think we will start seeing it slow down. \n\n**TL;DR:** Today was most likely a gamma squeeze coupled with some shorts covering. There were significant catalysts and whales to propel this thing. I don't think the GameStop story is anywhere near over. I'm sick sorry this was choppy writing compared to other posts.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, I am long on GME, this is a risky trade, thanks for reading.*",

The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.\n\nProspects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloomberg\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna's and Pfizer's and BioNTech's vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days. Remember Psychos, many of these stocks were overvalued 1-2 weeks ago, pullbacks like this represent an opportunity.\n* After reaching an impressive high of $58,000, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back around 10% today.\n* The dollar slid against major currencies, slumping to multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar, another sign of rising fears of inflation\n* Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law. Remember, as of now, Facebook (FB) is not showing any news to its users in Australia.\n* China\u2019s bank regulator on Saturday tightened requirements on the internet loan business of commercial banks, amid heightened scrutiny of online lending by internet giants such as Ant Group, the finance arm of Alibaba Group.\n* Albermarle (ALB) target raised by Argus from $140 to $177 at Buy.

The next morning the institution sees the BTC going down, he might need to dump some stocks to make up the loss of the $BTC. \n\nSo the trend might be enhanced by this loop, up or down, either way could be. And that might explain the moving of the market in the last few days and foreshadowing the future.\n\nThis is not a investment advice, only my personal thoughts.",

The logic follows that China should weather the chip shortage better than other countries, and that would mean their EV companies should see no slowdown.\n\nGiven the recent sell-off and China's resilience to the global chip shortage, now could be a great time to invest in Chinese EV companies.

The Ark funds have been hit hard and faced some liquidations. Cathie publicly told everyone her plan if faced with liquidations, she planned to sell the megacap stocks so she wouldn't have to touch her illiquid small caps.\n\nWell thats exactly what the ARK funds did this week. As of today ARKK no longer holds any FB, AMZN, AAPL, TSM and BABA. She sold all of it this week and bought more small caps and TSLA. Now ARK is is a very precarious situation. Their biggest stocks are now TSLA, PYPL, SHOP and SQ. If the sell off continues and ARK will be forced to sell these stocks or sell their illiquid small caps.\n\nA lot of people have taken note of this, including hedge funds which may enter predatory shorts if they think ARK is vulnerable. The next couple of weeks is crucial for ARK, should the market go back up they will look like geniuses, but should it go down...they will be in a world of pain.\n\nIf ARK is forced to sell the small caps which are illiquid, it will crash the prices and crater ARK's NAV. This will add to the bad performance and may accelerate redemptions creating a death spiral.\n\nEDIT: I was wrong about TSM. They still have .5% TSM",

            "selftext": "TLDR: EV in the next 10 years is going to become the biggest industry in the world, not because of it's green energy but because of automation. They're going to lead to the largest mass unemployment rise as they make drivers unnecessary\n\nI'd love people's opinions about my take on the future of EV and whether I'm off base or too optimistic\n\nDisclaimer: In NIO for 140 shares @ $22\n\nMy main argument: EV companies are currently amazon in their bookshop phase\n\nI would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV companies is seriously undervalued - I'm not basing this on the number of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery potential but on the billions they're investing in the development of full self driving automation.\n\nIn the next 10 years, we are likely to see full automation especially with the advent of quantum computing leading to a huge increase in computational power ([https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023)) - The companies that are heavily investing in developing this technology aren't the classic car manufactures such as GM, Chevrolet or Chrysler but instead the large EV companies that have grown exponentially in the past year. Like many people I'm viewing companies like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They're main value is in the code they develop for automation.\n\nOnce full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.\n\nThe main example I've been using for this is Domino's Pizza in the UK - They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let's say they conservatively they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours around lunch and three around dinner) - Let's also assume they only get paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about \u00a380mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do also cover - And that's only one company in the UK.\n\nIf automation occurs, which again these companies are investing heavily in and the underlying infrastructure and technology is beginning to reach basic requirements, these EV companies can create a code as service model along with the profit from actually selling the car and basically make drivers redundant\n\nMy argument is that basically at the moment these EV companies are amazon in their bookshop phase, people are betting that they'll sell lots of books (cars in this case because they're clean energy) and I think they're going to end up becoming juggernauts that basically take over our daily lives to the same extent amazon now does\n\nObvs I might be wrong and in fact I'd love to hear some bearish arguments - I'm not saying we're not in a bubble but I think these companies in 10 years time will be steals at their current prices\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A lot of people have mentioned the quantum computing point and how far we are away from it in normal conditions- which is a reasonable and valid point but I would argue that if you look at the rate of change of technological advances in the past 20 years (your phone in 2000 vs your phone now) - its not that crazy to say that this growth has risen exponentially and will carry on to meaning that **ONE OF THE MANY BARRIERS** to full automation will be knocked down (i.e reaching the necessary computational power for an ML model to process images real time) and could act as a domino effect",

            "selftext": "In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nAfter setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.\n\nChang and Ho told investors:\n\n>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*\n\nBitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg\u2019s report, America\u2019s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.\n\nThe strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the \u201cpoorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.\u201d\n\n[https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/jpmorgan-advises-clients-to-expose-1-of-their-portfolio-to-bitcoin-2431724](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/jpmorgan-advises-clients-to-expose-1-of-their-portfolio-to-bitcoin-2431724)",
